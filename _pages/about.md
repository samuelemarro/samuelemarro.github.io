I am a MSc student, researcher and TA at University of Bologna, working on adversarial attacks and the applications of optimization theory to ML. I'm also a member of the Institute of Superior Studies, UniBo's excellency school.

I also develop smart contracts for both research and industry purposes, and perform security audits of EVM and EVM-like smart contracts.

My research interests include adversarial attacks against both ML models and smart contracts, alternative training algorithms and inference-time optimization techniques.

This site also hosts a selection of [my projects](/projects/), along with [some extra writings](/blog/).
