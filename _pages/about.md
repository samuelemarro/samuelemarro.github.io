I am a MSc student, researcher and TA at University of Bologna, working on robustness and optimization. I'm also a member of the Institute of Superior Studies, UniBo's excellency school.

Additionally, I develop smart contracts for both research and industry purposes, and perform security audits of EVM and EVM-like smart contracts.

My research interests include inference-time optimization techniques, the role of autoregressivity in neural models, and in general how we can extend the inference-time capabilities of ML models.

This site also hosts a selection of [my projects](/projects/), along with [some extra writings](/blog/).
