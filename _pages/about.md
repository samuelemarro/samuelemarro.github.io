I am a DPhil student at Oxford University's [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/), working on theoretical properties of generative models and communication protocols for LLMs. My work is funded by Microsoft Research, to which I'm deeply grateful.

Before joining Oxford, I did a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at University of Bologna, as well as an Excellency Degree at the Institute of Superior Studies of Bologna.

This site also hosts a selection of [my projects](/projects/), along with [some extra writings](/blog/).
