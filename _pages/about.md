I am a DPhil student at Oxford University's [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/), working on agent communication and collaboration. My work is funded by Microsoft Ltd, to which I'm deeply grateful. I'm also the Chair of the [Lightweight Agent Standards Working Group](https://las-wg.org/).

I deeply care about building AI systems that are decentralized by design.

Before joining Oxford, I did a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at University of Bologna, as well as an Excellency Degree at the Institute of Superior Studies of Bologna.

This site also hosts [some extra writings](/blog/).
