I am an MSc student and predoctoral research fellow at University of Bologna, working on adversarial robustness and the applications of optimization theory to ML. I'm also a member of the Institute of Superior Studies, UniBo's excellency school.

My research interests include theoretical properties of adversarial attacks, alternative training algorithms and inference-time optimization techniques.

Additionally, I develop smart contracts for both research and industry purposes, and perform security audits of EVM and EVM-like smart contracts.

This site also hosts a selection of [my projects](/projects/), along with [some extra writings](/blog/).
