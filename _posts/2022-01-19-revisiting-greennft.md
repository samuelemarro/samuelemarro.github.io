In May 2021, [Luca Donno](https://twitter.com/lucadonnoh) and I published "Green NFTs: A Study on the Environmental Impact of Cryptoart Technologies", a 16-page investigation into the actual greenhouse gas impact of NFTs. While at the time the impact of blockchains was already well studied (see [de Vries' landmark paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776) on the topic), whether the NFT market played a role in emissions was still up for debate, with some even claiming that [NFTs have](https://medium.com/superrare/no-cryptoartists-arent-harming-the-planet-43182f72fc61) [no impact](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/nft-carbon-environmental-impact-1234589742/).

According to our model, that couldn't have been farther from the truth: spending 1 dollar on a transaction (either by minting an NFT, bidding or transferring it) causes an estimated emission of 1.305 kgCO2eq. To put that number in context, a typical NFT (using May 2021 data) would have emitted as much as driving 1862 km/1157 mi.

Our work (the paper + the companion website, now out of date) won a 3k USD award and is now cited by [Wikipedia's article on NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (which in my opinion still represents my greatest academic achievement).

The thing is, time flies very fast in the blockchain space, to the point where we were pretty sure that our results wouldn't have been relevant for more than a couple months. Is this what actually happened?

# Predictions, predictions

The paper made four medium-term predictions:
