    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: University of Bologna
      year: 2019 - Present
      description:
        - Developed, under prof. Michele Lombardi and Michela Milano, an <b>adversarial defense</b> (implemented in <b>Python</b> + <b>PyTorch</b>) which is robust against white-box attacks.
